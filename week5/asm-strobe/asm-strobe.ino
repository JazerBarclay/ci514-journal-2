/* 
 * Assembly Strobe
 * 
 * I improved futher my strobe example by moving my assembly
 * into a separate .S file associated with this sketch. I also
 * added use of push and pop for storing values on the stack
 * which are then recovered for regular subroutine execution.
 * 
 * All code can be found in the .S assembly file and can be
 * uploaded via the arduino IDE by using the compile and upload 
 * buttons from this .ino sketch file.
